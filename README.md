# South Kalimantan Flood

The flood in South Kalimantan, Indonesia, in January 2021, affected 11 out of 13 regencies and cities, with the most severely impacted being the Barito Kuala Regency, Banjar Regency, Banjarbaru City and Banjarmasin City.  The flood marked the worst in the last 60 years of province's history due to its scale, prolonged impact, and significant displacement of people.

Heavy rainfall and deforestation in the region, particularly the clearing of forests for palm oil plantations and mining, were major contributing factors. These activities disrupted the natural water absorption capacity of the land, making it more susceptible to flooding. The province, which typically experiences monsoon rains, saw unprecedented rainfall levels, leading to the overflowing of rivers, particularly the Barito River.

The disaster impacted over 112,000 people across the region, with at least 21 fatalities reported. The floodwaters reached depths of up to 2.5 meters in some areas and lasted for several days, with many regions submerged for more than a week. The economic losses were estimated at approximately IDR 1.35 trillion (around USD 95 million), primarily affecting agriculture, infrastructure, and housing. The flood marked one of the worst in the province's history due to its scale, prolonged impact, and significant displacement of people.

In this project, we aim to model flood map of 2021 January flood in most impacted area in South Kalimantan using Sentinel-1 Satellite data. The analysis was proceeded through Google Earth Engine.

Sentinel-1 satellite data is part of the Copernicus Earth Observation program, run by the European Space Agency (ESA). Sentinel-1 satellites can capture data in different radar polarization modes, which affect the orientation of transmitted and received radar waves:

1. VV (Vertical Transmit, Vertical Receive): Commonly used over water and flood mapping.
2. VH (Vertical Transmit, Horizontal Receive): Useful for distinguishing between surfaces like vegetation or urban areas.
3. HH and HV: Also available, depending on the region and mode of operation.

In this study we will specifically use VV wave.
